#Work Time Monitor
An employee monitoring system that takes screenshots of user systems on a network, and archives the screenshots as compiled videos. While also tracking user login and logout time.

THe server is built to work out of a raspberry pi, but any unix based computer like linux or a mac should work fine.

A major dependency is ffmpeg for dealing with videos. Make sure you have it compiled with libx64 support
